    "We are given the coordinates of a number of points and the degree of the desired polynomial for curve fitting.We have to find the polynomial coefficients using genetic algorithms for the given polynomial degree that performs the best fit.<br>\n",
    "It is possible that the real polynomial coefficients are non-integer numbers that due to our limitation to integer coefficients, we cannot find exactly the original polynomial coefficients. Our task is to provide the best estimate.<br><br>\n",

    "The variables of this section are:<br><br>\n",
    "polynomial_degree : This variable specifies the polynomial degree of the test case, which is used both in the test case generation function and as an input in the main code to find the coefficients.<br><br>\n",

    "## QUESTIONS : <br><br>\n",
    "### QUESTION 1 : <br><br>\n",
    "A very small population size causes the algorithm to get stuck in the local optimum and not find the real solution. Also, if this problem is solved, it will suffer from computational overhead.<br>\n",
    "A very large initial population causes an irrational increase in the execution time of the algorithm and the space cost of the algorithm.<br><br>\n",
    "### QUESTION 2 : <br><br>\n",
    "It increases the accuracy due to the increase in diversity in the chromosomes, which increases the chance of finding a suitable answer to the problem, but due to the increase in the amount of memory cost and also due to the increase in the length of the iterations, it increases the execution time.\n",
    "### QUESTION 3 : <br><br>\n",
    "The crossover operation combines the existing solutions, and since in the selection phase, the probability of choosing better members of the population of the previous generation is higher, then by combining the best solutions of the previous generation, on average, in the next generation, we generated solutions that are closer to the solution of the problem.<br>\n",
    "The mutation operation produces new answers outside the population of previous generations and increases the diversity of answers in the population, which increases the probability of reaching the right answer to the problem!<br>\n",
    "But it is not possible to use one of these processes alone, because if we only use crossover, we will be limited to the combinations of our first generation and we will not have any randomness in next generations to increase the diversity of answers, and this causes that if the initial population dont cover the answer, the algorithm cannot reach the answer.<br>\n",
    "Also, if we only use the mutation operation, since all the changes are random, there is no direction towards better answers in the population, and the answers produced move in all directions at the same speed on average.<br><br>\n",
    "### QUESTION 4 : <br><br>\n",
    "Running some optimizations to find the efficient values of the mutation and crossover p values can make the program more efficient . Also, using fixed size arrays and optimizing the functions can improve the performance .<br><br>\n",
    "### QUESTION 5 : <br><br>\n",
    "Due to the propagation of duplicate elements in next generations, it is possible that after a few generations, there will not be so much change in the production of new generations , which can be solved by checking whether duplicate answers are propagated to the next generation, which is done in the code. and by increasing the mutation probablity of the mutation we can increase the divesity .<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### QUESTION 6 : <br><br>\n",
    "Specifying the maximum number of program cycles.<br>\n",
    "Also, if necessary, it is possible to monitor the changes in the variance of the fitness of the generations, and if these changes are not so great for a significant number of generations, the execution of the program can be terminated and the closest solution found can be provided.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### QUESTION 7 : <br><br>\n",
    "It only affects the calculation time of the fitness function and this increase could have been a linear relationship with the increase in the polynomial degree but considering the time overhead to calculate higer powers make me realize this over head can be o(n^2) and omega(n) based on how efficient is the power operator .<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### QUESTION 8 : <br><br>\n",
    "Due to the repeated use of the input coordinates for each chromosome to calculate the fitness in each cycle of the program, it increases the program execution time. Also, if the degree of polynomial and the number of points, especially the number of points, exceed a certain value, we will experience an overflow during the calculation of fitness.<br><br>\n"
